# Quantum-Arena
School project #3, Small scale arena tank shooter


Game project 3 team 5 project named Quantum Arena

This was built by two programmers and one designer over 7 weeks

As a programmer this was my first experience with networking. I wanted to do something no one else was doing so I implemented steam functionality, sadly I never managed to get it working completely bug-free before the time ran out.

Overall I am happy with what we managed to accomplish as a lot of what we did was completely new to us and we had to learn a lot of new things
